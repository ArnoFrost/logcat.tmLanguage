# logcat.tmLanguage

I would like to do highlight logcat logs I've captured. [ADBView](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ADBView) was too much for me. I used to use its syntax file for sometime but then I have some `-v threadtime` logs at hand (ADBView only supports `-v time`).

I've hence written a syntax file from scratch with [AAAPackageDev](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AAAPackageDev). See the `YAML-tmLanguage` files for documentation. It should be self-explanatory.

It's recommended to use [MattDMo/Neon-color-scheme](https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-color-scheme) for the best result (PR pending). It is a great scheme BTW.

Enjoy.
